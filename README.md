# DNA Sequencing

# Instructions:

The genome of an organism stores all the genetic information necessary to 
build and maintain that organism. It is an organism’s complete set of DNA.

DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as:

A: Adenine
C: Cytosine
G: Guanine
T: Thymine


So a strand of DNA could look something like ACGAATTCCG.

Write a DNA.java program that determines whether there is a 
protein in a strand of DNA.

A protein has the following qualities:

1. It begins with a “start codon”: ATG.
2. It ends with a “stop codon”: TGA.
3. In between, each additional codon is a sequence of three nucleotides.


So for example:
- ATGCGATACTGA is a protein because it has the start codon ATG, 
the stop codon TGA, and the length is divisible by 3.

- ATGCGATAGA is not a protein because the sequence length is not 
divisible by 3, so the third condition is not satisfied.
